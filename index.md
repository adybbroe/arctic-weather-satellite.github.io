Performance evaluation of Arctic Weather Satellite data is an ESA funded project (contract number 4000136511/21/NL/IA) kicked off the 9th of December, 2021.

The Nordic Meteorological Services of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, operate regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models covering the Arctic and high latitude Nordic region. All four Nordic institutes are part of the ACCORD consortium, and as such share the same assimilation-code. SMHI, MET Norway and FMI (all partners in the MetCoOp consortium) operate one and the same model implementation covering the Scandinavian/Nordic domain. DMI operates its model (together with Iceland) on a set of different domains covering Denmark, as well as Iceland and Greenland (IGB model).
